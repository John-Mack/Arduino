# Arduino
Collection of Arduino code i wrote for my devices

As this is my first repo i'll try to add info as i go, such as the arduino device used, the IDE and exactly which sensor/button/screen i've used

Those would be the little arduino stuff i do as a hobby, i started at first to prove myself i was able, now i want to automate everything
since i'm broke this will go slow BUT it will advance with due time

My incoming project would be to buy my first Rasberry PI and to create an AI environment where the PI would communicate to the Gemini API and receive an answer shown either on-screen OLED or vocally using an speaker to an amp
In any case, compared to you all i'm WAY much a novice, but to my people around me i'm a big tech guy lmao, i'm just trying to prove them right by creating my own lil devices...
